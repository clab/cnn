# Translation with a Sequence to Sequence Network and Attention

Here is a Dynet version of the [PyTorch tutorial example "Translation with a Sequence to Sequence Network and Attention"](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/seq2seq_translation_tutorial.html).

## Data Preparation 

The data for this project is a set of many thousands of English to French translation pairs. Download the data from [here](https://download.pytorch.org/tutorial/data.zip) and extract it to the current directory. This part is the same as that in PyTorch tutorial.
